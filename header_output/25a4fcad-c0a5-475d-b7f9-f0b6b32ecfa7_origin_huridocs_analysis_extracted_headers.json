On or about February 23, 2016, the Securities Division of the Office of  the  Attorney  General  of  the  State  of  Maryland  initiated  an  investigation  into  the  franchise  related activities of 360 Painting, LLC and Paul Flick. On August 18, 2016, the defendants entered into a Consent Order with the Securities Commissioner, in which they agreed, without admitting or denying any of the Commissioner’s statements of fact or conclusions of law, except as to the Commissioner’s jurisdiction in the proceeding, (1) to immediately and permanently cease and desist from the offer and sale of franchises in  violation  of  the  Maryland  Franchise  Registration  and  Disclosure  Law;  (2)  to  promptly  file  with  the Securities Division and diligently pursue the completion of an initial application to register the 360 Painting franchise offering in Maryland; and (3) to send offers of rescission to two Maryland Franchisees, offering them  the  right  to  rescission  of  their  360  Painting  franchise  agreements  and  to  obtain  a  refund  of  initial franchise  fees.  In  an  Order  Modifying  Consent  Order  dated  January  4,  2017,  the  Consent  Order  was modified so that 360 Painting was not required to register its 360 Painting franchise offering in Maryland as long as no offers or sales of 360 Painting franchises were made in Maryland or to any Maryland residents. In the Consent Order, the Commissioner concluded that defendants had violated §§ 14-214, 14-216, 14- 228  and  14-229  of  the  Maryland  Franchise  Registration  and  Disclosure  Law  by  offering  and  selling franchises in Maryland and to Maryland residents while not registered in Maryland and using a Franchise Disclosure Document that failed to set forth all information the Securities Division requires, specifically that defendants failed to include certain litigation in Item 3. 360 Painting has corrected this error. The two Maryland Franchisees accepted the rescission offer.",
