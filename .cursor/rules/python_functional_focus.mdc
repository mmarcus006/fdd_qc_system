- **Functional Preference**: Default to pure functions. Avoid classes unless explicitly needed for stateful objects or specific patterns (like context managers) requested by the user.
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function must do ONE thing well.
- **DRY Principle**: Abstract repeated logic into helper functions immediately.
- **Minimize Nesting**: Aim for <= 3 levels of indentation. Refactor complex conditionals/loops into helper functions.
