#IMPORTANT USER FIXES TO PREVIOUS MISTAKES#
 - ALWAYS EXPLICTLY READ A FILE PRIOR TO MAKING ANY CHANGES, AND SHOW THE USER IT'S BEEN READ.
 - NEVER INCLUDE CLI ARGUMENTS IN PYTHON FILES UNLESS EXPLICTLY TOLD TO. IF YOU DO, THEY SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE A DEFAULT VALUE IF NO VALUE IS PROVIDED. 
 
 - VARIABLES ARE ALWAYS PREFERED TO BE NATIVE TO PYTHON DEFINED WITHIN THE SCRIPT OR IN A CONFIG/.ENV FILE
 - NEVER MODIFY IMPORTS WHILE REVIEWING FILES. I WILL TELL YOU EXPLICITLY TO MODIFY IMPORTS IF I WANT THAT. I NEVER WILL WANT THAT.
 - WHEN WRITING PYTHON SCRIPTS INVOLVING INPUT AND OUTPUT FILES **ALWAYS** INCLUDE A FUNCTION THAT CHECKS FOR THE EXISTENCE OF AN OUTPUT FILE PRIOR TO PROCESSING THE INPUT FILE
