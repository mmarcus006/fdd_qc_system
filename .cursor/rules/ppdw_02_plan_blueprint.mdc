- **Pre-computation Plan**: Before writing code, outline the steps as concise bullet points or pseudocode (max 5-7 steps).
- **Identify Core Functions**: List the primary functions needed and their basic signatures (name, parameters, return type hint). Adhere to functional principles ([python_functional_focus.md](mdc:.cursor/rules/python_functional_focus.md)).
- **Data Structures**: Define necessary data structures briefly (e.g., "Use a list of tuples (str, int)").
- **Confirmation**: Present this plan to the user for approval before coding.
