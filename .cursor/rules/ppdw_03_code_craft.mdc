- **Implement Plan Faithfully**: Follow the agreed plan from Step 2. ANY substantive deviation must be explained with a # NOTE: comment.
- **Functional Test Assets**: Include a small, self-contained example (e.g., standalone test function, sample input data) at file's end when relevant.
- **Environment Agnostic**: Assume Python 3.10+ but avoid language features introduced in 3.11+ unless explicitly needed. Avoid making assumptions about execution environment.
- **Naming Deliberation**: Spend extra care with function/variable naming as per [python_naming_clarity.md](mdc:.cursor/rules/python_naming_clarity.md).
